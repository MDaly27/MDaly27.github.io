      "content_html": "\n<h2>Reading 01 Reflection \u2013 Hackers in the Bazaar - 8/31/2025</h2>\n\n<p>This first part of <em>Hackers in the Bazaar</em> presented an inside look into the emerging hacker culture at MIT in the 50s\u201360s, looking into their social lives, the kind of technology they were building, and the larger implications to this movement.</p>\n\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"tx-0.jpg\" alt=\"Users working on a TX-0 computer\">\n  <figcaption style=\"color:#9aa3af; font-size:0.9em; text-align:center; margin-top:6px;\">\n    Users working on a TX-0 computer\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>In the late 50s, computers were only just starting to appear on college campuses, with MIT being one of the first. At this time, computers were still \u201cHulking Giant\u201d machines, taking up entire floors of buildings. Users would write programs in machine code by hand, punch them into cards, then hand them over to a team of dedicated computer operators, who would run programs in batches and then return the output at some later point. Users would not have the option to debug errors live, as computer time was scarce, and machines were often highly protected due to their cost.</p>\n\n<p>At MIT the origin of the hacker culture began with the TX-0 and PDP-1, early minicomputers either donated or procured by the institute. With these minicomputers, as opposed to the Hulking Giants, students were given unprecedented access to the actual machine. Among the group of students who gravitated towards the computers were a group of especially dedicated young engineers who subscribed to a revolutionary new set of ideas, known as the hacker ethic.</p>\n\n<p>The early hackers believed that the only way to understand something was to work with it hands on, and to learn exactly how it functioned. Additionally, to the hackers, producing actual results (whether a new version of <em>Spacewar!</em> or a compiler for LISP) was what really mattered, not characteristics like race, appearance, or social skills. Information, like source code, should be freely available to all, not locked behind any barriers. Finally, authority should be disobeyed whenever it got in the way of access to technology.</p>\n\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"Spacewar!-PDP-1-20070512.jpg\" alt=\"Spacewar! on the PDP-1\">\n  <figcaption style=\"color:#9aa3af; font-size:0.9em; text-align:center; margin-top:6px;\">\n    Spacewar! on the PDP-1\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>These new ideas were a whole new way of looking at the world, spurred by the new computers and the mindsets of the hackers who gravitated to them. They contrasted greatly with the bureaucratic routine of academia, especially at elite institutions. Though the hacker group at MIT was filled with technical geniuses who were building things even the military and IBM likely did not yet have, many failed out of college. They adopted a 30 hour work day, maximizing flow state time on the PC, often at the expense of their classes. Yet this did not deter the hackers, who felt the only important thing in the world was to create new innovations on the PC (called \u201cHacks\u201d) and showcase them to their hacker peers.</p>\n\n<p>The hacker culture at MIT is romanticized \u2013 a group of young kids delving into an unknown realm and creating such cool hacks as sci-fi games, telephone exploits, and the first programming languages. These shy and socially inept kids were able to find their power through the computer, and also build a community of like minded people. In reality this lifestyle worked for some for a little while, but also was simply unhealthy in the long run, and several of the MIT golden age hackers attempted suicide. This group made tremendous progress both in building new computer innovations, and also setting up the culture for digital freedom and cooperation that constitutes the hacker ethic. Yet in doing so they lived obsessive, asocial lives which often (and during a Vietnam Protest against the MIT lab even literally) barricaded themselves off from greater society in the process.</p>\n\n<p>Before reading this section, I had some idea of the origin of hackers, being the first master programmers. I was not however, aware of the true origins behind the culture, with the Tech Model Railroad Club at MIT. Also, the whole thing was so much more extreme than I would have anticipated. True hackers were doing 30 hour work days to grind out code, and even sleeping in cots at the computer lab \u2013 or even in the ceiling above it \u2013 jumping on the machine whenever someone scheduled to use it did not show up.</p>\n\n<p>To me, this hacker ethic is inspiring. It shows how people who may be outcasts among the greater public can find purpose and fit in. It also is somewhat scary, as I realize that to ever achieve the mastery of these elite hackers, a similar absolute devotion to hacking would be required. The great hackers like Greenblatt, Gosper, Samson, Kotok, Russell, and Nelson are to be admired, and their names should forever be part of the computer science origin story. Yet I would be cautious to mimic their lives exactly, seeing the extremes that they went during this golden age.</p>\n"

      "content_html": "\n<h2>Hardware Hackers Reflection</h2>\n\n<p>Hardware hackers maintained many of the tenets of the original True Hackers. They believed information and hands-on computer access should be open to the public to try. They also distrusted authority and held a disdain for bureaucracy, which they felt limited innovation.</p>\n\n<p>This new breed of hackers on the West Coast, however, were distinct in some ways from their MIT counterparts. Instead of closing themselves off from the general public and restricting their social circles to a small hacker group, the California hackers focused on spreading computing to everyone. Inspired in part by the political activism of the time, leading figures in the California movement believed computers could be a source of social change \u2014 but only if they were introduced to the public.</p>\n\n<p>To do so, groups built terminals in record shops and public libraries that connected back to a donated IBM \u201cHulking Giant\u201d machine in Berkeley. Meanwhile, new hardware innovations coming out of Silicon Valley enabled the introduction of the first microprocessors. Among them, the Altair 8080 stands as one of the most influential, opening computing to many new hobbyists \u2014 aided by marketing through growing computer magazines.</p>\n\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"homebrew.jpg\" alt=\"Meeting of the Homebrew Computer Club\">\n  <figcaption style=\"color:#9aa3af; font-size:0.9em; text-align:center; margin-top:6px;\">\n    Meeting of the Homebrew Computer Club\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>The Homebrew Computer Club, which formed largely to help users learn and share hacks on microprocessors, embodied the hacker ethic that information should be shared openly. Users built and shared tools, operating systems, and a version of Tiny BASIC with other members. They built on and improved each other\u2019s code.</p>\n\n<p>One member of the Homebrew Club was Steve Wozniak, who later partnered with Steve Jobs as the chief engineer of the hardware startup Apple. Woz embodied the West Coast hacker spirit, with a dream to make computers available to all. His work in developing the Apple I produced one of the first PCs that could be bought and used by the general public. This marked a great transition in hacking. With an explosion of new users, there was bound to be a completely new generation of hackers.</p>\n\n<p>This commercialization of computers did result in some tensions. As companies vied to produce the best and most profitable chips and computers, parts of the collaborative hacker spirit gave way to a more secretive culture at hardware firms. Although these companies began with the aim of providing computers to the masses, they gradually shifted away from one of the core tenets of the hacker ethic and toward authoritarianism.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, I agree that technology can be used for good, especially with the internet. The internet has allowed information to be shared more freely than ever before, which is certainly a positive. On the other hand, addictive social media has taken away some aspects of society, and I remain uncertain about the long-term effects of AI on humanity. Still, I ultimately think the internet was a necessary progression and has had overwhelmingly positive effects.</p>\n"
